# VH$ FILM LIBRARY

## Aim of the project

This software project aims to develop a program that allows users to search and display information about films from The Movie Database (TMDB). The program will utilize the TMDB API to retrieve film data, which will be organized and displayed in a user-friendly interface. Users will be able to search for films by title, genre, actor, and other criteria, and will be able to view detailed information about each film, including cast, rating, plot summary;  to make it easy for users to find the films they are looking for.
